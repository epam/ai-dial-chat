## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: ScheduledTaskCreateForm lib component matches the BFF create contract

`libs/scheduled-tasks` SHALL export a `ScheduledTaskCreateForm` component accepting `texts`, `values`, `errors`, `modelSelector` (`ReactNode`), `modelLabelId` (`string`), `onFieldChange`, `onCancel`, `onSubmit`, and optional `isSubmitting` (default `false`). `modelLabelId` is applied as the `id` of the Model or Agent field's `Label` element; the host generates it (e.g. via React `useId()`) rather than a hardcoded literal, and passes the same value as `modelSelector`'s own `aria-labelledby` target, so two concurrently-mounted form instances (or any future host reusing the component) never collide on a shared DOM id.

It SHALL render:

- **Display name** — required text input (`values.displayName`)
- **Description** — optional textarea (`values.description`), rendered between Display name and Repeat, with `maxLength={500}` and accessible feedback (e.g. a character count or inline validation message per `errors.description`) shown when the field is non-empty
- **Repeat** — a single dropdown (`DialSelectField`) bound to `values.repeat: ScheduledTaskRepeat` (`'oneTime' | 'hourly' | 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly'`), replacing the separate "Schedule type" (once/recurring) and "Frequency" (daily/weekly/monthly) dropdowns. It is NOT wrapped in a `<fieldset>`/`<legend>` with a visible "Schedule" section heading — the schedule controls render as a plain grouped block inside the Details column, which already carries its own `role="group"`/`aria-label` (`labels.detailsSectionTitle`)
- **Run at** — the internal `ScheduledTaskRunAtField` component (`libs/scheduled-tasks/src/components/ScheduledTaskRunAtField`, not re-exported from the package index), wrapping a `Calendar` control (`mode={CalendarMode.DateTime}`, imported from `@epam/ai-dial-ui-kit`) shown when `values.repeat === 'oneTime'`, bound to `values.runAt` (a `datetime-local`-style string) through the field's own `runAtToCalendarValue`/`calendarValueToRunAt` adaptation, with `errors.runAt` rendered below the control in the same inline-error pattern via the field's `errorClassName` prop. The field sets the earliest selectable moment to its mount time — a `minDate` pinned once per mount — so days strictly before the mount date render unselectable in the picker's month grid and activating them fires no `onFieldChange('runAt', …)`; the mount date itself and future days remain selectable. The earliest selectable moment is "now", not "now + lead": the page's existing submit-time lead validation (`runAt` must lead "now") is unchanged and still rejects `now`-ish selections at submit
- **Time** — a `Calendar` control (`mode={CalendarMode.Time}`, imported from `@epam/ai-dial-ui-kit`) shown when `values.repeat` is `'daily'`, `'weekly'`, or `'monthly'` (NOT shown for `'hourly'`), bound to `values.time` (`HH:mm` local wall-clock string, validated at app edge)
- **Day of week** — a `Calendar` control (`mode={CalendarMode.Weekday}`, imported from `@epam/ai-dial-ui-kit`) shown when `values.repeat === 'weekly'`, bound to `values.dayOfWeek` via `dayOfWeekToCalendarValue`/`calendarValueToDayOfWeek` (`libs/scheduled-tasks/src/utils/calendar-value.ts`), which convert between `Calendar`'s ISO weekday value (`"1"`=Monday..`"7"`=Sunday) and `values.dayOfWeek`'s APScheduler-convention string (`"0"`=Monday..`"6"`=Sunday)
- **Day of month** — shown when `values.repeat === 'monthly'` (`values.dayOfMonth`)
- **Minute** — a required text input (matching the `Day of month` field's `Input` pattern) shown when `values.repeat === 'hourly'`, bound to `values.minute` (a `"0"`-`"59"` string); no `Time`, `Day of week`, or `Day of month` field is rendered for `'hourly'`
- **Model or Agent** — a required field rendering the host-supplied `modelSelector` element in place of a lib-owned selection control, wrapped in the lib's own required-label/error markup (the "Model or Agent" label, a required marker, and `errors.modelId` rendered below the control) using the same visual pattern already used for `Calendar` fields without a built-in `labelProps` (see `withRequiredMarker`). The lib performs no deployment lookup, filtering, or catalog navigation itself — it only renders whatever `modelSelector` the host passes.
- **Prompt** — required textarea (`values.prompt`)
- **Cancel / Create** actions

`values` SHALL NOT include a `stream` field, and the form MUST NOT render a stream toggle — scheduled task runs are always non-streaming background executions and this is not a user-configurable option.

`description` is optional and MUST NOT participate in the Create-button required-field guard. The Create action SHALL be disabled while `isSubmitting` is `true` or while `displayName`, `values.modelId`, or `prompt` are empty (minimum client-side guard; full validation lives in the page). `values.modelId` itself continues to be owned and set by the host via the `modelSelector` element's own `onSelect` callback (bound to `onFieldChange('modelId', ...)` by the host, outside the lib) — the lib's required-field guard reads `values.modelId` exactly as it did before this change; only the rendered control changed.

The `Run at` and `Time` `Calendar` controls' `onChange` callbacks (inside `ScheduledTaskRunAtField` for `runAt`, in the form for `time`) MUST adapt the ui-kit's `CalendarValue` (`Date | string | null`) into calls to `onFieldChange('runAt', ...)` / `onFieldChange('time', ...)` using the same value shapes the page already consumes (`values.runAt` as a `Date`-constructible value, `values.time` as an `"HH:mm"` string) — this is a UI-control swap, not a change to the `values`/`onFieldChange` contract.

The component MUST NOT import from `apps/chat`, `server-api`, any generated API client, routing, feature-flag context, notification context, deployments context, auth, env, or analytics. Importing `Calendar`/`CalendarMode` from `@epam/ai-dial-ui-kit` is permitted — it is a generic design-system control with no host-specific integration knowledge. `modelSelector` MUST remain an opaque `ReactNode` prop — the lib MUST NOT know it is a deployment selector, a dropdown, or anything about its internal behavior.

#### Scenario: Required-field guard blocks submit

- **WHEN** `displayName` is empty or `values.modelId` is unset
- **THEN** the Create button is disabled

#### Scenario: Submitting is reflected in the UI

- **WHEN** `isSubmitting` is `true`
- **THEN** the Create button is disabled and shows a busy/loading affordance

#### Scenario: Model field renders the host-supplied selector as an opaque slot

- **WHEN** `ScheduledTaskCreateForm` renders with `modelSelector={<button>Select Model or Agent</button>}`
- **THEN** that exact element renders in the Model or Agent field's position, wrapped by the lib's own "Model or Agent" required label and (when present) `errors.modelId` message, and the lib performs no deployment/API fetch

#### Scenario: Model field label id comes from the host, not a hardcoded literal

- **WHEN** `ScheduledTaskCreateForm` renders with `modelLabelId="a-generated-id"`
- **THEN** the "Model or Agent" `Label` element's `id` is `"a-generated-id"`, and `ScheduledTaskCreatePage`/`ScheduledTaskEditPage` each generate this value via `useId()` rather than sharing a fixed string literal, so two instances of the form never collide on the same DOM id

#### Scenario: Lib has no host or integration imports

- **WHEN** `libs/scheduled-tasks` source (including `ScheduledTaskCreateForm`) is statically analyzed
- **THEN** it contains no imports of `apps/chat/*`, `@epam/chat-api-client`, `server-api`, routing, feature-flag, notification, deployments, auth, env, or analytics modules; imports of `Calendar`/`CalendarMode` from `@epam/ai-dial-ui-kit` are present and allowed

#### Scenario: Empty description does not block submit

- **WHEN** `description` is empty, and `displayName`, `modelId`, and `prompt` are all filled
- **THEN** the Create button is enabled

#### Scenario: Description field enforces the 500-character limit client-side

- **WHEN** the user types into the Description textarea
- **THEN** the input cannot exceed 500 characters (`maxLength={500}`), and accessible feedback is shown once the field is non-empty

#### Scenario: No visible Schedule section heading is rendered

- **WHEN** the create-task form renders
- **THEN** no "Schedule" (or equivalently-worded) section legend or heading appears above the Repeat dropdown; the Repeat control and its conditional fields render inside the Details column's existing `role="group"` with no additional heading element

#### Scenario: One-time repeat uses the Calendar DateTime control

- **WHEN** `values.repeat === 'oneTime'`
- **THEN** the "Run at" field renders `Calendar` with `mode={CalendarMode.DateTime}`, not a native `<input type="datetime-local">`, and no Time, Day of week, or Day of month field renders

#### Scenario: Hourly repeat renders a Minute field and no time, weekday, or month-day fields

- **WHEN** `values.repeat === 'hourly'`
- **THEN** the "Minute" `Input` renders bound to `values.minute`, and no Time, Day of week, or Day of month field renders

#### Scenario: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly repeat values use the Calendar Time control

- **WHEN** `values.repeat` is `'daily'`, `'weekly'`, or `'monthly'`
- **THEN** the "Time" field renders `Calendar` with `mode={CalendarMode.Time}`, not a native `<input type="time">`

#### Scenario: Weekly repeat uses the Calendar Weekday control with ISO/APScheduler conversion

- **WHEN** `values.repeat === 'weekly'` and the user selects Monday in the "Day of week" `Calendar` (`mode={CalendarMode.Weekday}`, ISO value `"1"`)
- **THEN** `onFieldChange('dayOfWeek', '0')` is called (APScheduler convention), not `'1'`

#### Scenario: Form does not expose a stream control

- **WHEN** the create-task form renders
- **THEN** no stream toggle or `values.stream`-bound control is present in the rendered output

#### Scenario: Past days are unselectable in the run-at picker

- **WHEN** `values.repeat === 'oneTime'` and the user opens the run-at picker's month grid
- **THEN** every day strictly before the field's mount date renders disabled, and activating such a day fires no `onFieldChange('runAt', …)` — the out-of-range click is a no-op

#### Scenario: The mount date and future days remain selectable

- **WHEN** the user activates the field's mount date or any later day in the run-at picker
- **THEN** `onFieldChange('runAt', <datetime-local string>)` fires with the picked moment (local midnight when no time-of-day was set yet; the pre-picked time-of-day is kept when one exists)

#### Scenario: The earliest selectable moment does not change while the form stays open

- **WHEN** the create or edit form re-renders repeatedly after the run-at field mounted (e.g. the user edits other fields for several minutes)
- **THEN** the earliest selectable moment stays pinned at the field's mount time rather than advancing with each render, and the memoized `minDate` identity does not churn the `Calendar`'s internal effects
