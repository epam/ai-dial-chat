# E2E tests

The package contains Dial end-to-end tests. Tests are implemented using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) framework.

## Prerequisites

Tests are using Auth0 credentials to access an application.

When run tests on CI, `E2E_USERNAME` and `E2E_PASSWORD` CI variable should be set to perform Auth0 login.

## Run tests locally

Run `nx e2e chat-e2e` to execute the tests locally.
Installation of default browsers may be required, when run for the 1st time.

Local version of application is automatically started before execution the tests on `http://localhost:3000`.
Config file used for local run is `local.playwright.config.ts`.

After tests execution finished, 2 kind of reports are generated: html, allure.

Before generating Allure report, install it on your local machine following the guide: https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_get_started.

To open html report, run the command `npx playwright show-report apps\chat-e2e\html-report`.

Allure report is opened in default browser using `allure serve apps/chat-e2e/allure-results`.

Every test inside local report contains video recording and trace attached.

If need to execute tests inside docker container run:

```
# Unix
docker run --rm --network host -v "$(pwd)":/test/ -w /test/ -it mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.36.0-jammy /bin/bash

# Win
docker run --rm --network host -v ${pwd}:/test/ -w /test/ -it mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.36.0-jammy /bin/bash

npm i
nx e2e chat-e2e
```

Image version should correspond Playwright version.

## Run tests on CI

Config file used for CI pipeline: `playwright.config.ts`.

`nx e2e chat-e2e --configuration=production` command is used to trigger tests on CI.

Generated Allure report is attached as a job artifact.
To view CI Allure report:

- for Chrome: run `chrome.exe --disable-web-security --disable-gpu --user-data-dir=~/chromeTemp`
- for FireFox: open `about:config` in browser and set `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy` to false.

CI report includes screenshots for failed tests.
