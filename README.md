# DIAL Chat

DIAL Chat is a default UI for [AI DIAL](https://epam-rail.com). AI DIAL can be used as headless system, but UI is recommended to learn the capability.

Originally forked from [chatbot-ui](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui) and then completely reworked and published under [apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE), while code taken from original repository is still subject to [original MIT license](./license-original). Due to rework we introduced lots of new features such as various IDP support, model side-by-side compare, [DIAL extensions](https://epam-rail.com/extension-framework) support, conversation replays, branding and many more.
