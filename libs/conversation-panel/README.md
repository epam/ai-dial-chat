# @epam/ai-dial-conversation-panel

Panel component for browsing conversation history with virtual scrolling, grouped views, tab filtering, and search.

## Overview

`@epam/ai-dial-conversation-panel` renders the conversation history sidebar that lets users navigate between past chats. It addresses the performance and UX challenges that come with displaying large conversation histories: rows are rendered through `react-window` so the DOM stays small even with thousands of entries; conversations are grouped into a Pinned section plus per-source sections (`FilterTab`) with collapsible headers, so users can quickly locate work; and a tab bar with a search field narrows the list without a full page reload. Rows support drag-and-drop reordering between groups, per-row action menus, task badges, and unread indicators. Use this library whenever an application needs a left-rail or slide-in drawer that shows the user's chat history with standard navigation affordances. The library is intentionally data-agnostic — it accepts an already-ordered flat list of `ConversationItem` objects and emits callbacks for selection, actions, and moves, leaving sorting, storage, and routing entirely to the consuming app.

## Components

### ConversationPanel

Root component. Renders the full panel with header, search, tab filters, grouped list, and empty states.

```tsx
import { ConversationPanel } from '@epam/ai-dial-conversation-panel';
import type { ConversationPanelProps } from '@epam/ai-dial-conversation-panel';

<ConversationPanel
  conversations={historyItems}
  isOpen={isPanelOpen}
  onSelectConversation={handleSelectConversation}
  activeConversationId={activeConversationId}
  onNewChat={handleNewChat}
  getActions={buildRowActions}
  onMoveConversation={handleMove}
  labels={{
    title: 'Chats',
    emptyLabel: 'No conversations yet',
    noResultsLabel: 'No results found',
    newChatLabel: 'New chat',
    searchPlaceholder: 'Search…',
    searchClearLabel: 'Clear search',
    filterLabels: {
      all: 'All',
      myChats: 'My chats',
      shared: 'Shared',
      organization: 'Organization',
    },
  }}
/>;
```

Pass `isFilterTabsHidden` to drop the All / My chats / Shared / Organization
row. The list then stays on whichever tab is active — `FilterTab.All` unless
`activeFilter` says otherwise — so every group remains visible; only the
control disappears. `labels.filterLabels` stays required either way.

## Enums

```tsx
import { FilterTab } from '@epam/ai-dial-conversation-panel';

FilterTab.All; // 'all'
FilterTab.Pinned; // 'pinned' — also identifies the Pinned collapsible group
FilterTab.MyChats; // 'my-chats' — also used as a conversation's source/ownership
FilterTab.Shared; // 'shared'
FilterTab.Organization; // 'organization'
```

## Types

```tsx
import type {
  ConversationPanelProps,
  ConversationPanelLabels,
  ConversationPanelStyles,
  ConversationPanelTypography,
  ConversationColors,
  NewChatButtonColors,
  ConversationItem,
  ConversationMove,
  FilterLabels,
  PillTabsColors,
  PillTabsStyles,
  PillTabsTypography,
} from '@epam/ai-dial-conversation-panel';
```

### ConversationItem

Data shape for each conversation entry in the list. Only `id` and `title` are
required.

```tsx
interface ConversationItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  isPinned?: boolean;
  source?: FilterTab;
  iconUrl?: string;
  iconTooltip?: string;
  isIconLoading?: boolean;
  href?: string;
  showTaskBadge?: boolean;
  taskBadgeLabel?: string;
  isUnread?: boolean;
}
```

The panel does not sort — it renders `conversations` in the order given, so
recency ordering is the host's job. Grouping is derived from `isPinned` and
`source`.

### ConversationMove

Payload for a completed drag-and-drop move: the dragged `draggedId`, the
`targetGroupKey` it landed in, and `afterId` — the item to insert after, or
`null` for the top of that group.
