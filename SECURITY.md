# Reporting Security Issues

We take all security reports seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

⚠️ Please do *not* file GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities as they are public! ⚠️

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/epam/HUH/security/advisories/new) tab. Tip: In this form, only the title and description are mandatory.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress toward a fix and full announcement and may ask for additional information or guidance.

When we receive such reports, we will investigate and subsequently address any potential vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.
