# Reporting Security Issues

We take all security reports seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-chat/security/advisories/new) tab.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress toward a fix and full announcement and may ask for additional information or guidance.

When we receive such reports, we will investigate and subsequently address any potential vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.

Please do *not* create a public GitHub issue in this project.
